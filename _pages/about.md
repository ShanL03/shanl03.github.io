Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in [ECEE](https://ecee.engineering.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University (ASU), and Director of the [Medical Automation, Robotics & General Intelligence Lab (MARGIN Lab)](https://marginlab.github.io/). Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of California San Diego with [Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/). I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Washington, supervised by [Blake Hannaford](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hannaford/), and earned my M.S. at Vanderbilt University, advised by [Robert J. Webster III](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vise/visepeople/bob-webster/).

My research interests are in **AI + robotics, surgical robotics, and medical devices**, with the overarching goal of intelligent healthcare and autonomous surgery. My work covers robotic perception, motion planning, control, and manipulation. Outside of research, I love outdoor sports such as climbing and hiking.

We are always looking for highly talented and motivated students! If you are interested in joining my lab, please visit our [Opportunities page](https://marginlab.github.io/opportunities) for more information.
